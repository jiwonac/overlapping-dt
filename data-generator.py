def data_generator(num_sources, distribution, costs, num_groups, group_dists):
	"""
	Generates overlapping synthetic data based on number of sources and a precise
	specification of the distribution of data. 

	Parameters:
		num_sources (int): a nonnegative number of sources
		distribution (dict): a dictionary that maps from a tuple of sources to a
							 nonnegative number of tuples in the overlap
							 e.g.: (1, -2): 3, (-1, 2): 2, (1, 2): 1
							 means 3 tuples in source 1 but not in source 2, 
							 2 tuples in source 2 but not in source 1, and
							 1 tuple in source 1 and 2. 
							 The dictionary must be correctly and thoroughly
							 formatted as this function doesn't check if it
							 is valid. 
		costs (list): a list of costs for each source of length num_sources
		num_groups (int): a positive number of groups
		group_dists (list): a list of group distributions
							e.g. [(5, 6), (1, 2), (2, 3)] is a valid group 
							distribution 3 data sources and 2 groups. 
	
	Returns:
		a list of data sources
		a data point is a dictionary: {"val": "some_string", "cost": some_float, 
									   "group": some_int}
		a data source is a list of data points
